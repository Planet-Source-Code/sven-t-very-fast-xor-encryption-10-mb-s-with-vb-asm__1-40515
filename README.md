### Description

This project provides a class for xor encryption that can handle strings and files.

The class is over 100 times faster than normal vb-code, it encrypts with up to 13 MB/s!

VB does only about 0.1 MB/s, that means it encrypts a 10MB string in less than 1 second, where other routines posted on psc would take about 90 seconds!

You can also pass files to the class which will be encrypted with up to 6 MB/s!

(tested on a P-II 350)

How it works:

The class doesn't use any dlls, it all works with vb-code and a little bit assembler!

another advantage of this technique is that it has the same speed when it is used in the ide.

The sourcecode is commented, so i think you can also learn something about using asm in vb.

I hope you find it useful, thanks for your vote.
